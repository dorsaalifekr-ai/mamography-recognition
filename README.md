# ü©∫ Mammography Recognition Project

**Year:** 2023  
**Environment:** Google Colab  

This project was originally developed in **Google Colab** and later refined through **manual review and optimization**.  
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a deep learning model for **mammogram image classification**, helping to identify potential abnormalities in breast tissue.
